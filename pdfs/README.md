# PDFs Directory

Place all your PDF files that you want to analyze in this directory.

## Requirements:
- The PDF filenames should match what you specify in your `input_json/challenge1b_input.json` file
- Supported formats: PDF files only
- No size limit specified, but keep processing time in mind

## Example:
If your `challenge1b_input.json` specifies:
```json
"documents": [
  {
    "filename": "travel_guide.pdf",
    "title": "Travel Guide"
  }
]
```

Then place `travel_guide.pdf` in this directory.
